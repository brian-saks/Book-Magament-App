## About
This proyect serves as a proof of concept / demo presented to a local school to assess their interest in a full-scale project.

The aim was to showcase the basic functionalities of book management, including the ability to add, edit, and delete records (CRUD).

Through this demo, we seek to validate the project's feasibility and explore how it can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the school, fostering a more organized and accessible learning environment for students and staff.

The data was sourced from an online database of books to provide content for the demo.
